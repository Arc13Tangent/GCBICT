## Example: Qualified-Defective separator
## Training
Users type $\texttt{Q}$ to select the Qualified-Defective separator. Then type $\texttt{Q}$
and $\texttt{D}$ to determine the directories of folders that contain qualified beans
and defective beans, respectively. Each folder can contain multiple images of
beans.

After the above steps, type $\texttt{T}$ to obtain the model of support vector machine (SVM) type. The model file is placed in the “Model” folder.

## Identification
After the training stage, users type $\texttt{E}$ to leave the training mode, and then type $\texttt{I}$ to select the identification mode. In the identification mode, choose the folder containing the images of unevaluated beans as input and use the model obtained in the training stage to identify the qualified and defective beans in the chosen folder.
