## Getting started
To clone the source code from GitHub, type 
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/Arc13Tangent/GCBICT.git
```
in the command line, then navigate to the GCBICT folder and type 
```console
$ cd GCBICT
$ pip install -r Requirements.txt
```
to install all the required packages specified in the ```Requirements.txt```.

## Using GCBICT
To run GCBICT, open the terminal, navigate to the GCBICT folder, and input the command ```python main.py```:
```console
$ cd GCBICT
$ python main.py # or python3 main.py
```

## Example 1: Identification of qualified beans
### Training
Users type ```Q``` to select the Qualified-Defective Separator. 
Then, respectively, type ```Q``` and ```D``` to input the folders' paths where the images of the qualified and defective beans of the training set are stored.

</div>
<br> 

After the above steps, 
type ```T``` to obtain the model of support vector machine (SVM) type. The model file is placed in the ```Model``` folder.

### Identification
After the training stage, users type ```E``` to leave the training mode, and then type ```I``` to select the identification mode. 
In the identification mode, 
input the path of the folder where the images of unevaluated beans are stored.
Then the GCBICT uses the model obtained in the training stage to identify the qualified and defective beans of the test set.

## Example 2: Identification of the growing site of beans
### Training
The user first types ```E``` to leave the Qualified-Defective Separator and then types ```M``` to select the Mixed Separator.
Next, type ```T``` to select the training mode. 
Then type ```C``` to specify the number of growing sites, and input the path of the folder where the images of beans of each growing site in the training set are stored.

Next, type ```T``` to obtain the model of support vector machine (SVM) type. 
The model file is placed in the “Model” folder
and the confusion matrix of the machine learning model is shown in the following graph.

### Identification
After the training stage, users type ```E``` to leave the training mode 
and then type ```I``` to select the identification mode. In the identification mode, input the path of the folder where the images of unevaluated beans are stored. Then the GCBICT uses the model obtained in the training stage to identify the growing sites of beans in the test set. The result is placed in the “Result” folder.
### Result
